## Dependencies
* Python 3.8
* [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

We're using [pipenv](https://pipenv-es.readthedocs.io/es/stable/basics.html) to create and manage a virtual environment containing all required packages. You have to install pipenv first using pip:
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

To initially create the virutal environment from pipfile run:
```bash
pipenv install
```

To start the server within the the virtual environment run:
```bash
pipenv run <add our command here>
```

You can also run a shell inside the virutal environment running:
```bash
pipenv shell
```
