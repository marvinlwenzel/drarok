## Install
We're using [pipenv](https://pipenv-es.readthedocs.io/es/stable/basics.html) to create and manage a virtual environment containing all required packages. You have to install pipenv first using pip:
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

To run the server within the the virtual environment use:
```bash
pipenv run <command>
```
or start a shell within the environment using:
```bash
pipenv shell
```
